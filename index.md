### Welcome

I wanted a place to post current, commonly requested information for the wonderful people I work with. I could have made a website or blog, a wiki, or whatever. But, why not GitHub Pages? It's pretty simple, actually.

Find me:
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stevelange)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenlange/)
* [Email](mailto:stevenl@microsoft.com)

This is my way of keeping you updated. What can you find here?

* Easy-to-digest articles addressing common questions I get from other customers, like **[how Azure DevOps licensing works](/pages/AzureDevOpsLicensingPrimer.html)**.
* Links to places to find upcoming events.
* Resources to **[learn more about Azure, DevOps, and cloud development](/pages/LearnAzure.html)**.
* A consolidated **[collection of programs](/pages/MicrosoftPrograms.html)** to jumpstart or optimize your journey to the cloud.


I’m completely open to suggestions as well. Let me know of anything you think is missing and I’ll get it added! Just shoot me an [email](mailto:stevenl@microsoft.com).
